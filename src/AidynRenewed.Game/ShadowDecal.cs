/// Draws a body's <see cref="BodyShadow"/> as a decal on the ground.

/// <remarks>
/// The original draws a flat square without testing depth, before the bodies and the nearby scene
/// objects, which draw over it. So it never sinks into ground that's uneven or that isn't quite
/// where the collision is. A decal of the same square, projected onto the ground, looks the same
/// without that trouble. It leaves out <see cref="BodyLayer"/>, so bodies stay on top.
/// <para>
/// Where the ground bends, the flat square would carry on through it. The decal instead fades out
/// toward the top and bottom of its box, so no edge of the box shows, and a bank or wall beside
/// the body takes only a little. Godot can also fade a decal off surfaces angled away from it,
/// but that hid the shadow even on level ground: unlit meshes carry no normals, and the ones
/// Godot makes for them don't face up.
