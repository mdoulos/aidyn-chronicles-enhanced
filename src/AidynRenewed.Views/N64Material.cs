/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The N64 has no linear light. Texels, vertex colours and tints are the values it puts on screen
/// (the game turns the VI's gamma off), and the combiner multiplies them as they are. The export
/// stores colours as linear, as glTF requires, so the shader turns them back into on-screen values,
/// multiplies and fogs there as the N64 does, and hands Godot the linear result, or with
/// <see cref="OnScreenFramebuffer"/> the on-screen values themselves, so that Godot blends them as
/// the N64 does.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Textured draws are texel × shade × prim, and untextured ones shade × prim (<c>setStaticMode</c>'s
/// combine modes, cycle 2 multiplying by <c>PRIMITIVE</c>). Shade is the vertex colour on unlit
/// display lists, and the RSP's lighting on lit ones (see <see cref="Lighting"/>). Prim is the
/// scene's tint (<c>SceneData.colorFloats</c>): <see cref="TintParameter"/> for
/// scenery, averaged with a scene object's own tint where it has one, and white for what the sun
/// lights instead. Untextured draws also take the mesh's tint colour.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The shade and the fog are worked out per vertex, in on-screen values, and interpolated as the RDP does: in on-screen
/// values, straight across the screen, without perspective. Interpolating the glTF's linear vertex colours instead made
/// every blend between a bright vertex and a dark one brighter and less tinted (Oriana's hut's floor, whose vertices run
/// from white to a dim teal, came out warm where the original's is green).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// With <see cref="RspLighting"/>, as in the runtime and the editor, lit display lists are lit per vertex as the
/// RSP lights them: an ambient plus the sun's colour times the cosine to it, clamped to 1, in
/// on-screen values, from the sky's globals (<see cref="SetSky"/>, <see cref="SetSkyLight"/>). A body's or an actor's lights
/// reach only the vertices the RSP loaded first of a pair (the export's second coordinates); the rest take the ambient alone.
/// Without it, Godot's lights stand in.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Fog is the RSP's: a per-vertex amount from the depth buffer's <c>z / w</c>, between the fog
/// start and end on the 0–1000 scale <c>gSPFogPosition</c> takes, blended toward the fog colour
/// in on-screen values before the pixel is drawn (<c>G_RM_FOG_SHADE_A</c>). Draws that Godot's
