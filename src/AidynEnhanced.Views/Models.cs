/// first, but the main thread never waits for another to finish one: Godot's renderer serves other threads' calls on the main
/// thread, between frames, so a thread parsing a scene can be waiting on the main thread, and the main thread waiting on it
/// would never go on. It parses a copy of its own instead, which happens only when both want the same asset at once. Its nodes
