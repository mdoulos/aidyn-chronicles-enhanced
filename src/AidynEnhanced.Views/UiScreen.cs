/// <remarks>
/// The original draws its UI images pixel for pixel: they're texture rectangles with bilinear
/// filtering on, which at 1:1 samples each texel exactly, and only a scaled image, such as the
/// conversation box's gradient, is filtered. So the canvas filters linearly, as the console does,
/// and the screen is drawn at its own size and scaled up afterwards by <see cref="Filter"/>.
/// <see cref="Lines"/> sets its height: 240 is the original's, and 480 draws everything half the
/// size, with room for twice as much. It's never narrower than 4:3; a narrower control shows it
/// letterboxed.
