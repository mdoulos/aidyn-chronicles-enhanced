/// <para>
/// Two kinds. A node the animation both turns and scales: Godot's player sets a node's rotation and scale apart, each rebuilt
/// from what the node holds, which loses one scaled unevenly or to nothing. The opening's spell (Borg6 0x2292's transform 2),
/// scaled from nothing to (5, 0.01, 5) as it spins, came out with its rotation and scale on the wrong axes, a disc seen edge-on
/// where the original shows it face-on.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// And a node the animation holds at rest in a channel: Godot's glTF loader leaves out a track whose every key is the node's
/// rest value, so the node kept what the animation before left it, where the original sets every channel its Borg6 drives each
/// tick (docs/formats/animation.md). Phelan's lying states in the final cut-scene (<c>aidyn:actor/0x2918</c>'s 9 to 13) hold
/// his hips turned and lowered and a leg scaled to nothing at their rest values: played after his idle, which stands him on
/// both legs, he stood oddly posed at his hips' height, his death's pool of blood about his knee. Those channels are posed
/// at rest from the glTF (<see cref="DrivenNodes"/>).
