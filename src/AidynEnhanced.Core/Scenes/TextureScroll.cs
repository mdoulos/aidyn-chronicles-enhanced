/// <summary>
/// A texture that scrolls, such as water or fire (Borg1 flag 0x200). The game shifts its bitmap

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Borg1's scroll byte controls it, and the game writes to it as a counter. With a low nibble
/// of 0, each load shifts the image by the high nibble. Otherwise the high nibble counts loads up to
/// the low nibble, and on the load that finds them equal, it shifts by that many texels and starts
/// counting again. So 0x02 shifts 2 texels every third load, and 0x10 one texel every load.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A shift moves the image toward +S: after it, texel <c>s</c> holds what texel <c>s − n</c> held.
/// The game shifts the base level only, and none of the textures that scroll have mip levels. It
/// shifts 16-bit texels for RGBA16 and IA16 and 32-bit words for the rest, which is only right for
/// RGBA32, and those three formats are the only ones that scroll.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// There's no check for a new frame, but the state isn't shared. The game loads each scene it
/// places as a copy of its own (<c>BorgAnimLoadScene</c> sets <c>borgFlag</c>), and a scrolling
/// texture leaves the Borg cache as it's loaded (<c>InitBorgTexture</c>, for flag 0x100), so each
/// copy of a scene has a copy of the texture of its own. It moves once per <c>LoadTexture</c> of it
/// in the scene's instructions each time that copy of the scene is drawn, which is once a frame,
/// and stays put while the scene isn't drawn. Checked against the debug ROM's machine code.
