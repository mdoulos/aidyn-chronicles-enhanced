/// scrolling textures such as water, lava and fire. The see-through scenes are nearly all scrolling water; B22's also
/// holds a strip of beach, which the rain splashes on. Scene objects are taken at their
/// nearest level of detail, as their runtime node places it, whatever level is drawn, and as their scene stands before
/// anything animates it. Billboards and bodies aren't in it, so rain passes through them. A scene's triangles are read once,
/// and can be read ahead of time on any thread (<see cref="Warm"/>), which changes nothing but when.
