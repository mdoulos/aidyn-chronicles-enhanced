/// <remarks>
/// The weather may change whenever the part of the day changes, and whenever the player enters a chunk of another
/// terrain. Each time, a d100 over <paramref name="KeepAtMost"/> clears the weather and tries for precipitation: a
/// second d100 at most the season's chance plus the terrain's brings it. A third d100 under
/// <paramref name="FallBelow"/> makes it rain (or snow), and otherwise it's fog. Every d100 is 1 to 100, so with the
/// base game's 75 and 70, a quarter of the chances change the weather, and precipitation is rain or snow 69% of the
/// time and fog 31%.
