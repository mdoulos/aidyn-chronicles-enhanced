/// <para>
/// Each track holds a value and its first three forward differences, and each tick adds each
/// difference to the one before it, so the value follows a polynomial of up to third degree. Only
/// as many are stepped as the current key's mask reaches: a key of just a value (mask 1) holds it,
/// mask 2 or 3 steps linearly, 6 or 7 quadratically, and 14 or 15 cubically. A later key usually
/// loads only the differences (mask 14), so the curve carries on from its value without a jump.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A track's counter starts at 1. At each tick, a key whose tick equals the counter loads (from its
/// first stored value on, the ones it leaves out become 0), then the state steps and the counter
/// goes up. When the counter reaches the length, the track instead goes back to its first key
/// without stepping. So after <c>n</c> ticks, <see cref="Time"/> is <c>1 + n</c> and each value is
/// its curve at that time, and the tracks loop every <see cref="Borg6Animation.Length"/> ticks.

/// <para>
/// A driven channel is set to its track's value: the game zeroes it, then adds the value times the
/// animation's weight, which is always 1. The differences are also written to fields nothing reads.
