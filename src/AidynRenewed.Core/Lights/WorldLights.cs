/// it's one of the party's (the player in trek), the light map objects that the grid cell under its centre lists in
/// its own chunk (<c>WorldLights.ForBody</c>, 0x8004d878). An actor a map places, unless it's fullbright, gets the sun
/// while outdoor, the dynamic lights and every light map object of its own chunk (<c>MapObjects.SetActorLights</c>,
/// 0x80013ac4, <c>Lights.AddZone</c>, 0x8004d9b0). Chunk scenery and plain scene objects get none: they keep the
/// white ambient every scene starts with.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Each light (<c>WorldLights.AddNear</c>, 0x8004d384), if it's active: an occludable one is skipped if a sphere of 0.25
/// swept from it to the body's centre hits a triangle facing it, see-through ones aside; then one no nearer than its
/// radius is skipped. Otherwise its falloff is (radius − distance) / radius, straight-line and in 3D. The first time
/// in a frame something reaches it, its colour moves on by the frame's ticks and is scaled by that falloff, in place;
/// every time, the colour is scaled again by the screen fade's level and added as a directional light from the body
/// toward the light, or toward the camera's eye for one that faces the camera. So what a light reaches second in a
