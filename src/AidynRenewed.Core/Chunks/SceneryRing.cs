/// The Draw Distance setting's Extended, a port addition: on the Overworld, the 16 chunks round the 3×3 the chunk streamer keeps
/// loaded, so that the 5×5 around the player is drawn. They're scenery only: their scenes and the scene objects their maps
/// place, and nothing else. They have no collision, sounds, lights or wanderers, their map objects do nothing, and loading
/// them is no map load, so what map objects remember doesn't age by them. Which scene objects show is decided as the 3×3's
/// are, by their flag gates and the memory that keeps a put-out light out (<see cref="LoadedMap.Scenery"/>), read without
/// changing either.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// It's the runtime's alone: the core's game never holds one, so a game plays the same whatever the setting, and a headless run
/// plays as the runtime's does. It follows the 3×3 (<see cref="ChunkStreamer.Centre"/>) rather than leading it, so it's
/// <see cref="Update"/>d after the streamer, and it's empty while the 3×3 is, as under a cut-scene's stage or a battle's arena,
/// which keep the original's 3×3 and planes. Other map sets keep the 3×3: interiors and the towns' sets are walled in.
