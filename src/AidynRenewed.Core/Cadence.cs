/// How the port turns the original's per-frame behaviour into per-tick steps (ADR 0017).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The original runs its logic once per rendered frame, with the number of 60 Hz ticks since the
/// last frame as its delta, and at 15–25 fps a frame covers several. Most of it loops over the
/// ticks, so it doesn't care, but some of it acts once a frame, and some loops toward a target
/// that only moves once a frame. Those parts run faster at a higher frame rate: the camera turns
/// behind the player about twice as fast per second at 30 fps as at 60. The port steps every tick
/// and scales those parts to what the original does at an idealized 30 fps.
