/// A camera object's hold on the camera while the player is in its reach (<c>processVoxelCamera</c>):
/// it moves the camera, or its aim, to a point by cutting, panning or easing, and can keep it aimed at
/// the player. Cut-scenes move the camera with the same moves (<c>AllocScriptCamera</c>), aimed at an
/// actor rather than the player. Checked against the debug ROM's machine code.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The first tick in reach starts the move from wherever the camera is: a cut jumps there, a pan goes
/// at a steady speed and the eases follow their curve, each over <see cref="Duration"/> ticks. Tracking
/// chases the player at 1/24 of the way a tick, but no more than 0.25. A finished move stays done while
/// he stays in reach: the original marks it to start again, but the tick it's stepped overwrites the
/// mark. Out of reach for a tick, it starts afresh next time.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The original also aims straight at the player as every tracking move starts. Running, the aim
/// trails him by about 1.4, so a pan or an ease taking over jolted the view; the user saw it in the
/// original too, and chose to fix it (ADR 0018). The port snaps the aim only when
/// the move cuts, where the view jumps anyway, and otherwise carries on chasing from where it was.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// While it moves the camera or its aim, the follow camera leaves the camera be (<see cref="FollowCamera.Hold"/>).
/// Flags 0x100 and 0x200 instead set how far behind and how high the outdoor camera follows.
/// </para>
/// </remarks>
/// <param name="point">
/// Where it moves the camera or its aim to, in the world. Without one, just above the focus: its
/// bottom, plus the follow camera's height (<see cref="FollowCamera.Height"/>), or 0.5 in a conversation.
/// </param>
/// <param name="values">Z is <see cref="Duration"/>; with flag 0x100, Y is the distance, and with 0x200, X the pitch in degrees.</param>
