/// The original's rectangle is (0, 200) to (300, 230) in its 320 × 240 frame, its text 25 in and 5 down in the main font,
/// in (225, 225, 225, 200), left aligned and wrapping at 295, 11 pixels a line. It grows upward to fit
/// (<c>TextBand.SetText</c>, <c>0x80055a80</c>): when the text and 5 above and below it are taller than 30, the top is
/// 230 less that, so two lines put it at 198 and four at 176. Over the band is the conversation box's gradient,
/// <c>0x1C3</c>, 11 tall. The band is drawn from x 0, under the overscan bar, and the bottom bar hides it below 228, so it
/// touches the screen's bottom and left; but <c>SetText</c> lays it out again to the rectangle's right, 300, where the
/// constructor had 320, so it stops 4 short of the right bar. The port takes that for a slip and runs it to the right as
/// well, as the user chose (Oct 17, 2026).

/// The port lays it out in the original's frame at the bottom centre of the UI screen, as the conversation box is, so the
/// text wraps as authored at any size. Like that box it floats rather than running under bars it doesn't draw: the band
/// is inside where the side bars would be, feathered beside it and above it with the popups' pieces, but it runs down
/// to the screen's bottom, which it's anchored to, with no feathering there. The user chose this shape (Oct 17, 2026).
/// The battle's log box is the same widget, floated as the conversation box instead.
