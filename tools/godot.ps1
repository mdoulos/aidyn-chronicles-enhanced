# Run the pinned Godot editor (.NET build), downloading it on first use.
# Usage: tools/godot.ps1 [<godot arguments>...]
#        tools/godot.ps1 -ExePath    # print the executable's path and exit
#
# Examples:
#   tools/godot.ps1 --path src/AidynRenewed.Editor --editor
#   tools/godot.ps1 --path src/AidynRenewed.Editor
#
# The version and its hashes are in tools/godot-pin.ps1, which fetches the
# editor from the official GitHub release, checks it against the release's
# SHA-512 and unpacks it into the gitignored .tools/.
#
# There's no param block on purpose: PowerShell would bind Godot's own options
# to it (it read --path as a -Path switch), so every argument goes to Godot as is.
