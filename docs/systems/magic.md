# Magic: spells, potions and enchantments (roadmap 2.5)

`AidynEnhanced.Core.Magic`: `Casting` (the roll, the resist, targets), `EffectLanding` (where every effect lands), `EffectRules` (what a lasting effect does each round and as it ends), `SpellValues` (the AI's) and `IMagicHost` (what an effect asks of the battle). The effects on a character are in `Character.Effects.cs` (`ActiveEffect`), drinking in `Potions` ([items](items.md#potions)) and a cast in a battle in `Battle.Magic.cs`. [ADR 0020](../adr/0020-one-effect-vocabulary.md) makes spells, potions and enchantments data: a record lists **effects**, each of a type the core implements, configured by parameters (`EffectRecords.cs` in `AidynEnhanced.Plugins`). [ADR 0021](../adr/0021-instant-effects-land-in-one-place.md) lands every carrier's effects through `EffectLanding`, and makes a potion's use and a spell's area the records'. What the player sees is in [engine-behaviour](../engine-behaviour.md#magic).

What the original does is from 1.0's machine code and the combat checkpoints. A name with an address is the original's, in the symbol map (`Entity.`, `Spell.`, `EffectRecord.`, `PotionRecord.` and `Combatant.` are coined); one without is the port's. Several of `Casting`'s members share their original's name.

## The records

- **A spell** (`aidyn:spell/0x03…`) has the spell DB's fields and its `effects`, its `duration` (1800 game-clock ticks a level for those that last, the battle for Wraith Touch, none for the rest), its `aspect` and `placed` (the ROM's `unk1E` bits 1, 2 and 0x10, [db](../formats/db.md)), who resists it, the `filter` of entities it may take, and its `aiValue`, all written as facts from 1.0's code (`MagicImporter`).
- **A spell's `area`**: the AI centres it on its opponents, and a party member who knows it makes the enemies spread out ([combat](combat.md#the-ai)). Only Fireball, kind 8, which the code names (`EnemyAI.AreaCentre` `0x80058008`, `EnemyAI.AimAreaSpell` `0x8005974C`, `Combat.CreatePartyCombatants` `0x8005C7C8`).
- **A potion** (`aidyn:item/0x10nn`) has its effects and duration: 648,000 ticks (`0x9E340`, 3 hours of game time) for the stat, skill and Defence potions. Its `use` says where it's used: `DrinkInTrek`, `DrinkInBattle`, `Throw` ([below](#potions-and-flasks)).
- **Gear** names a spell and a level: an item's `spell` is cast when used, with charges; an armor's or gear's `enchantment` is on while worn; a weapon's `enchantment` is cast at the target of each hit.
- **The magic record** (`aidyn:magic/0`) holds casting's numbers. The chance's factors, the improvement factor and the resist roll's aspect factors are read from the code segment (`CodeTable.CastingFactors`, `0x800D29CC`, the same in all three ROMs).

## A spell's kind

The code keys a spell by its **kind**, its place in the spell table (`SpellList`, `0x800E2B40`; the record's `position`): `GetIdIndex` turns an ID into it, and the effect records, the AI's values and the special-case lists are all by kind. There are 59, IDs `0x0300`–`0x033F` with five gaps. The ROM's item records hold spell IDs; the item tables in RAM hold kinds. The port keys by record ID throughout, so modded spells need no kind.

## What each spell does

Sorted by what the code does with it (`Entity.AddEffect` `0x800702F0`, `Combatant.ApplySpellEffect` `0x800646E0`, `EffectRules.Round` `0x80070A3C`, `EffectRules.End` `0x800707EC`). "L" is the cast's effective level; a record is a timed effect, L × 1800 ticks.

| Type | Spells (kind) | What the code does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stat` | Strength (10), Endurance (19), Brilliance (13), Stamina (32), Dexterity (51) +2L; Debilitation (5), Weakness (22), Stupidity (14), Exhaustion (31), Clumsiness (52) −2L | base and modified (`Character.AddStat` `0x800723E8`: not on the dead; Endurance, and the Level while Endurance is 0, left at 1 at the least) |
| `protection` | Air Shield (3), Spirit Shield (35), Starlight Shield (48), 2L | the sheet's protection byte; Spirit and Starlight Shield take off L as they end |
| `ward` | vs. Elemental, Naming, Necromancy, Star (38–41), 6L | added to the resist roll against that school (`0x80061F3C`, the first such record by slot) |
| `damage` | Dragon Flames (6, Fire), Earth Smite (7, Earth), Fireball (8, Fire, L), Lightning (9, Water), Crushing Death (28), Whitefire (58), Wind at an opponent (11, Air) | (margin + the damage byte, or L for Fireball) d6, times the resistances that meet it |
| `damagePerRound` | Immolation (0), Acid Bolt (24) 1d6; Web of Starlight (57) 2d6 | each round, if no more than the target's hit points |
| `poison` | Poison (36) | each round, L >> 1 of Endurance's current value, no more than it has, not if hit points are below it |
| `healPerRound` | Photosynthesis (46); the Ring of Healing | heals the cast's margin each round, not when the clock says night (`World+1`) |
| `immobilise` | Wall of Bones (34), Frozen Doom (53), Web of Starlight (57) | clears the combatant's active flag; the Shadow is immune; Web is escaped each round on a d100 under twice Strength |
| `charm` | Control Elem (4), Charming (16), Control Marquis (17), Control Zombies (27) | toggles the hostile flag; as it ends, an enemy goes back to the enemies and a member to the party |
| `fieldRadius` | Haste (30) +L; Stellar Gravity (56) −L | `Combatant.UpdateRadius` (`0x8005F29C`), record by record: Gravity takes L off, leaving 1 if that's as much or more |
| `morale` | Aura of Death (25), Solar Wrath (47), −L | the AI record's morale, no more than it has, and a morale check due; given back exactly as it ends (`EffectRules.End`, `0x800707EC`), by its timer, a dispel, a lethal blow or leaving the field (`Combatant.Death` takes off only the holds); a party member, with no AI record, is untouched |
| `stamina` | Tap Stamina (33): the target −2L, the caster +2L up to its base (a record on each); Wind on an ally +2L to Stamina and its maximum (`Entity.AddStaminaEffect`, `0x80072158`, never given back) | once |
| `weather` | Wind on an ally | as it ends, combat's weather class to 1 (`World+4`) |
| `cure` | Remove Poison (2): Poison records cast with a lower margin than this cast's | once (`Entity.CurePoison`, `0x80071A6C`) |
| `dispel` | Dispel Elemental, Naming, Necro, Star (42–45) | every record of the school, if the margin × their number reaches the sum of their margins (`Entity.Dispel`, `0x80071CD8`); unschooled ones never |
| `partOfDay` | Darkness (29) night, Light (54) day | the other's records come off everyone, and the battle's part of the day is held (`Entity.SetLight`, `0x80071BDC`) |
| `cheatDeath` | Cheat Death (23) | a blow that kills heals twice the margin instead, and the record ends (`Character.TakeDamage`, `0x8006EB8C`) |
| `reflect` | Mirror (37), 3L | the combatant's counter (`+0x28`), which the resist roll spends; it isn't taken back as Mirror ends |
| `drainStat` | Wraith Touch (26) | Intelligence, Willpower, Dexterity or Strength (`0x800D34B0`, by 1d4) less 2d6, base and modified, for the battle; the record's margin byte holds the stat |
| `banish` | Banishing (15) | (margin + the target's hit points) d6 |
| `flee`, `teleport` | Escape (1), Teleportation (12) | the targets flee if the battle allows; the caster moves to the placed point if it's free, not in the Shadow's battle (`Battle.TeleportBarred`) |
| `senseAura`, `revealPhase` | Sense Aura (21), Detect Moon Phase (49), Detect Sun Phase (50) | the details popup, by the level ([combat](combat.md#spells-potions-and-skills-in-a-turn)); trek's sundial's moon or sun, which a battle neither draws nor has (1.0 writes through a null pointer; the port does nothing) |
| none | Detecting Traps (18), Opening (20), and Stealth (55, Stealth +6L) | target type Field: "Spell Unavailable"; nothing casts them anywhere |

No spell both deals damage and leaves a record: the damage byte of Immolation, Acid Bolt, Wraith Touch, Frozen Doom and Web only routes the original's code (`Spell.AddsEffect`, `0x8007AAB4`). Whether a damage spell is Fire, Earth, Water or Air isn't a field: `Combatant.SpellResistanceApplies` (`0x80061C5C`) names the kinds, which the importer writes as the `damage` effect's elements.

## Casting

`Combatant.CastSpell` (`0x800648CC`), once per target of the selection (`Combatant.CastCurrentSpell`, `0x80065C08`). The port's is `Battle.Cast(caster, source, targets)`.

1. **Available** (`0x800635B8`): a Field spell is "Spell Unavailable" (shown and queued, the cast's margin `0xFE`); the target must meet the spell's special (`Casting.Requirement`): a True Name, the heavy flag set (which the party, the rats and ordinary humanoids have and the 32 big creatures haven't, so "heavy" means small enough), or an aspect. Day and Night specials test the battle's part of the day; no spell has one. A player's refused cast shows "%s" with the requirement's line, the Common strings' 258–270 (`Spell.CastMessages`, `0x800E2C00`, a pointer the string loader sets; `Combatant.LogMissingComponent`, `0x800638C8`).
2. **The level** (`Casting.Level`): a known spell's level, no higher than the caster's modified Wizard; an item's spell its own.
3. **Prepared,** once (`PrepareCast`, `0x8006406C`, skipped while the acted flag is up):
   - a known spell (`AttemptCast`, `0x80063F7C`): the reagent out of the party's inventory, unless the caster is from the enemy list or the AI plays it (`Combatant.CheckReagent`, `0x80063BFC`, "Missing spell component"); the cost, max(1, the spell's Stamina − L), from the worn items' batteries and then Stamina (`Equipment.PayStamina`, "Not enough ST", the reagent kept); then the roll;
   - an item's spell: a charge, which only a wand or a scroll worn as gear spends (`0x80070E0C`); no reagent, Stamina or roll: the margin is a d100's step.
4. **The roll** (`Casting.Chance`, `0x80063CA0`): (modified Intelligence × 4 + L × 6 + base Level) × a factor, the moon's phase's for a Lunar caster (0.5, 0.75, 1.25, 1.5), the battle's part of the day's for anyone else (0.75, 1.25, 1.25, 0.75, 0.75 from morning to night), truncated, times the Troubadour's scale, at least 5. A d100 at or under the modified Wizard, and under a fifth of the chance, has a second d100 taken off it (`Casting.AdjustRoll`, `0x80062594`). Under the chance succeeds, with the margin the step of what's left (`Party.SkillCheckStep`, `0x80008654`); otherwise the reagent comes back, "fails to cast the spell", the refused cast's puff of smoke plays at the caster ([combat](combat.md#what-spells-look-like)), and the next target tries again with another. Cast or not, a spell at level 0 or 1 may rise a level: a d100 at or under (5 − L)² × 0.1, halved on a failure (`ResolveCastRoll`, `0x80063DF4`).
5. **Resisted** (`Casting.Resist`, `0x80064298`), by everyone for a spell at enemies or a placed area, by the other side for Wind, by no one for the rest, and never by the Marquis for Wall of Bones: (modified Willpower × 3 + modified Endurance + base Level) plus its ward, × 0.75 for a Solar or Lunar spell when the two share an aspect or 1.25 when they don't. A d100 over it doesn't resist; otherwise its step comes off the margin, and a step of the margin or more resists, as does any while Mirror's counter lasts, which spends the difference.
6. **What it does** (`Combatant.ApplySpellEffect`): the disable limit, then the effects for the target's side land (`EffectLanding.Land`, [below](#how-effects-land)), the lasting ones as a record; the lines say a Banishing, a dispel that took nothing, or the cast. **The disable limit** (`0x80063A00`): while reserves are still to come, the party's side can't charm or hold an enemy while more than two in the enemies' slots are charmed or held. The blocked cast still does damage ([below](#the-originals-quirks-the-port-keeps)).
7. **Damage:** (margin + the dice) d6, times every resistance of the target's and its worn items' that meets the spell (`Combatant.SpellDamage`, `0x800649E4`): at least 1, unless a resistance is 0. `Battle.Cast` returns it in the outcome; the state that shows the numbers deals it.

**Targets** (`Casting.TargetCount`, `0x80060818`): one, every one the spell may take, or (L + 1) >> 1. `Casting.CanTarget` (`0x80060988`) wants the target alive and in play, on the side the spell's type wants, not under the spell already, and allowed by the filter. The reach is L × the range byte, or L from the placed point (`Casting.Reach`).

**A weapon's spell** (`Combatant.WeaponSpellProc`, `0x800627D0`; `Battle.Strike`) is cast after every melee and ranged hit when it may take the target: an item's spell at the enchantment's level, its damage added to the hit's; its margin is the attacker's cast margin until the turn ends.

## How effects land

`EffectLanding.Land` is the one place a spell's, a potion's or a flask's effects land on a target (ADR 0021), so a plugin's spell that heals or potion that dispels does what the base game's carriers do. In the record's order:

- **Once:** `damage` adds its dice and `banish` the target's hit points to the d6 over the margin, which the carrier rolls (the cast through the resistances; drinking and a flask as that many d6, no margin); `dispel` (`Entity.Dispel`, `0x80071CD8`), `cure` (`Entity.CurePoison`, `0x80071A6C`) and `heal` (`Entity.HealPercent`, `0x800715DC`, none in the Shadow's battle: `Battle.HealingBarred`) act on the sheet; `flee`, `teleport`, `senseAura` and `revealPhase` ask the battle (`IMagicHost`), and do nothing in trek.
- **A lasting effect on a record with no duration** starts and leaves nothing: the Stamina potion's Stamina, the base game's one.
- **`blast` and `corrode`** burst together about a cell (`IMagicHost.Burst`, [below](#potions-and-flasks)): where a flask landed, or the target's cell for a spell or a drunk potion. A flask's blast has the damage its throw rolled; anyone else's rolls its dice as it lands.
- **With a duration**, the lasting effects go on the target as one record (`Character.AddEffect`), Tap Stamina's gain on the caster as another.

A spell lands at its cast's level and margin. A potion or flask lands at level 0 and **margin 255** (`Potions.Margin`), which its dispel and cure weigh, as the original's Antidote adds its Remove Poison at 255; its lasting record keeps margin 0, as the original's potion record has none. A dispel of the unschooled school takes nothing off.

## Effects on a character

**The record** (the original's `EffectRecord`, 0x18 bytes, 15 at `entity+0x34`): `+0` kind, `+1` power (L), `+2` the spell's school, `+3` the margin after the resist, `+4` u32 harmful, `+8` u32 timer in game-clock ticks (`0xFFFFFFFF` never runs down), `+0x14` the visual's handle, whose end ends its lasting scene ([combat](combat.md#what-spells-look-like)). **Potions'** (the original's `PotionRecord`, 0xC bytes, 7 at `entity+0x38`): kind, power, u32 timer, the visual. The port's is `ActiveEffect`, held in two slot arrays (`Character.Effects`, `PotionEffects`), as their order is the RNG's. The combat checkpoints 08–12 hold live records and their timers.

- **Adding** (`Character.AddEffect`): the first free slot. A spell already on, or one with no slot free, adds nothing and doesn't refresh, though the cast still costs; targeting rules it out first. A potion isn't checked: drinking checks.
- **Ageing** (`Character.AgeEffects`, the original's `0x80071444`): the potions, then the spells (`EffectRules.Round`). A combat round takes 600 off each timer, 10 seconds of game time (the original's `TurnOrder.EndRound`, `0x8006A62C`, for every combatant in play; the port's `Battle.AgeEffects`). Trek takes the clock's 72 a tick of play, not while the pause menu is open (the original's `TrekLoop.TickClock`, `0x80020cb4`; the port's `GameState.PassTime`), so a potion's 3 hours last 9,000 ticks of play. A timer at 0 ends on the next ageing, so a cast of L lasts 3L rounds and its per-round effects run 3L times. A dead character's don't age.
- **Ending** (`Character.RemoveEffect`, `0x800724B8`): each effect undone (`EffectRules.End`).
- **Death** (`Character.TakeDamage`): a Cheat Death on the dead heals twice its margin (`& 0x7FFF`, shifted) and ends; otherwise, in a battle, every spell's record comes off, and every potion's, and if that brought the character back its Endurance, Stamina and Level are put to 0 (`0x80071E28`). Taking a stat back does nothing to the dead, so a buff on the dead stays raised ([below](#the-originals-quirks-the-port-keeps)).
- **A battle's end** (`Character.EndBattleEffects`, the original's `Entity.ClearEffects` `0x80071830`): the potions but Stealth's (`MagicRecord.KeptAfterBattle`), every spell record, then the armor's, shield's and gear's enchantments back on.
- **What reads them** besides the table's rules: `Combatant.IsImmobilised` (`0x80062250`), which an attack's chance and whether a combatant can act ask ([combat](combat.md#a-turn)), and the AI's morale, −1 for any harmful record.

## Potions and flasks

A potion is data (ADR 0021): an item of kind Potion whose record has its effects and its `use`. The core has no list of them.

**Drinking** (`Potions.Drink`; trek's `0x8006FE34`, combat's `Combatant.DrinkPotion` `0x80064C84`) lands the potion's effects on the drinker ([above](#how-effects-land)) and uses one up. Whether it can (`Potions.CanDrink`, `0x8006FBE8`) follows from the record: its `use` must allow it here (`DrinkInTrek` from the pause menu, `DrinkInBattle` from C-up's), and a flask (`Throw`) or a potion with no effects (Aspect, Jumping) never; then a lasting one if it isn't working already; otherwise a heal below full health, a cure or a dispel with something to take off, Stamina below its base (a signed compare, `slt`), or any other effect. Refused, it says why and uses nothing ([items](items.md#potions)). The importer writes `Throw` on the four flasks, `DrinkInTrek` alone on Stealth, which C-up's menu leaves out (`CombatMenu.ListPotions`, `0x80088190`, skips kinds below 4 and kind 16), and both on the rest. In a battle C-up's menu lists only those `CanDrink` allows, and drinking shows no number.

| Potion | Effects |
| --- | --- |
| Healing, Curing | heal 15–25% or 40–60% of the maximum, drawn whole, worked in single precision and truncated (`HealByPotion`); none in the Shadow's battle |
| Stamina | cure Exhaustion, then Stamina to its base |
| Antidote | cure Poison (the original adds Remove Poison at margin 255) |
| Restore | cure Wraith Touch, Debilitation, Weakness, Exhaustion, Stupidity, Clumsiness (`0x800D34B4`) |
| Strength, Dexterity | the stat's base +10 for 648,000 ticks, not on the dead |
| Clarity, Charisma, Stealth | Loremaster, Diplomat or Stealth +3, which does nothing to a skill the character can't learn |
| Defence | protection +15 (the original adds it in `Combatant.TotalProtection`) |
| Fire, Inferno, Acid flasks | blast 4d6, 8d6, 2d6 (`FlaskDamage`, `0x80065270`, which rolls all three and takes one) |
| Sleep Gas | blast of 15 from Stamina: no sleep and no duration |
| Acid | and corrosion: a 2d6 radius, each within it −(radius ÷ squared distance) protection until the battle ends |

**The blast** (`FlaskExplosion`, `0x800652F8`): each living combatant at a squared distance d from the landing cell, **kept in a byte** (so it wraps at 256) and at least 1, within the damage takes the damage ÷ d, left at 1 at the least if it isn't the target; friendly fire happens. The target then takes its share again as the blow lands (`Combat.EndCast`), so twice, which the number and the line show once, as the user saw in 1.0 and 1.1. The port keeps the damage and the byte, the user's choice, and its line and number give both shares, Sleep Gas's Stamina included ([combat](combat.md#where-the-port-differs)). Acid's corrosion goes on those within its radius instead of the damage, stacking. **The throw** (`ThrowChance`, `0x80064EFC`), the last flask of a stack, which the original never bursts and the port does (the user's choice), and the rest of a flask's turn are [combat](combat.md#spells-potions-and-skills-in-a-turn)'s.

In the port, the throw rolls the `blast` dice of every thrown potion's record, in the records' order, and keeps its own, as the original's `FlaskDamage` rolls all three, so the RNG stays in step. The flask then lands through `EffectLanding` on the one it hit (`Battle.FlaskExplosion`), and its blast and corrosion burst in `IMagicHost.Burst`, corrosion as a `protection` of −1 a level at the radius ÷ d.

## Gear

- **Worn enchantments** go on with the armor, shield or gear (`Character.PutOnEnchantment`, from `Equipment`), never running down, and come off with it (the first of the spell's that never runs down). A dispel can take one off until the battle's end puts it back. Only three exist: the Haste Amulet (Haste 1), the Boots of Speed (Haste 5) and the Ring of Healing (Photosynthesis 1, margin 1).
- **Charges** go only from wands and scrolls worn as gear; the spells of weapons, armor, shields and other gear never run out. Nothing recharges them (`Party.RechargeItems`, `0x80078D5C`, is empty). Batteries are [items](items.md#equipment)'.
- **Resistances** on the body armor, shield, weapon and the 12 gear slots count with the character's own (`Equipment.Resistances`).

## The AI's values

`SpellValues.Value` (`EnemyAI.SpellValue`, `0x80057498`): the record's `aiValue`, or with none the highest the loaded spells give its first effect's type; and 0 when its type finds nothing to do: a `cure` with no candidate under what it cures (`0x8005B734`), a `charm` or `banish` whose filter allows no candidate (`0x8005B60C`, `0x8005B6AC`), `partOfDay` unless it changes the part of the day and the balance favours it (+1 for each combatant the light now hinders on the caster's side, or doesn't on the other's, −1 for the rest; `0x800615B4`), a `dispel` unless the school's timed records harm its side or help the other's more than not. The values range from 0 (Escape, Teleportation, the moon and sun, the morale spells) to 85 (Darkness, Light): a spell for its own side 51–85, a debuff or hold 31–43, damage 11–22, which is why enemies buff ahead ([combat](combat.md#the-ai)). The conditional types read set B's candidates as it's built from the cell scored.

**What the AI may cast** (`Combatant.AICanCast`, `0x80060A94`, inside `CanCast` for a combatant the AI plays), for every source, an item's too: the Stamina for the cost at the casting level, a charge on an item's, the target's requirement and the part of the day. It never asks for a reagent: `CheckReagent` skips an enemy or an AI-played caster.

## The original's quirks the port keeps

The user chose to keep these, which look like bugs, as the original has them:

- **Spirit and Starlight Shield leave protection behind.** They add 2 a level but take off 1 a level as they end (`0x800707EC`), so each cast leaves a level of protection on the character until a load rebuilds the sheet. It's a parameter a mod can change (`ProtectionEffect.Leaves`).
- **Wind on an ally raises Stamina and its maximum for good.** It adds 2 a level to Stamina's base and modified values (`Entity.AddStaminaEffect`, `0x80072158`), and nothing takes it back, so maximum hit points rise with each cast until a load. It's a parameter too (`StaminaEffect.RaisesMaximum`).
- **A blocked charm or hold still hurts.** When the disable limit stops a charm or an immobilise, `ApplySpellEffect` logs that the target resists but returns 0, not −1, so `CastSpell` still rolls (margin) d6 of damage at the target (`0x800646E0`, `0x800648CC`). `Battle.Cast` returns that damage.
- **The dead keep their buffs.** `Entity.SubStat` (`0x80072450`) does nothing to a dead character, so when death takes a spell's or potion's effects off, a raised stat stays raised. Endurance's and Stamina's raise the maximum hit points too, until a load.

## Where the port differs

- The Defence potion and the Acid flask's corrosion change the sheet's protection, as the shields do, where the original adds them when it works out the total (`Combatant.TotalProtection`); the totals differ only when the sum is below 0.
- One record can hold several effects; the original keys one per kind. The base game's records hold one each but Web of Starlight's (immobilise and 2d6) and Tap Stamina's.
- Any spell, potion or flask can carry any effect type ([How effects land](#how-effects-land)); the original's code carries each instant one for its own kinds only. The base game's records hold them where the original has them, so nothing it plays changes.
- Trek's ageing runs every tick, and what the effects do each round once a 30 fps frame (`Cadence.FrameTicks`), as the original does once a drawn frame.
- The battle's held part of the day is the battle's alone (`Battle.PartOfDay`, `PartOfDayHeld`): it isn't written to the part-of-day flags. The original's lock (`World+5`) also stops the weather rolling; the port's battle still steps the clock and the weather each turn (`GameState.AdvanceTurn`), and doesn't stop the roll while a Day or Night spell holds the part of the day ([weather](weather.md)).

## Not settled

- Whether a worn Ring of Healing really heals every frame in trek ([user-checks](../user-checks.md)).
- What Wind's weather class 1 does in combat: weather.md calls it fog, and Wind's description says it clears fog.
- The `unk1E` bits 0x20, 0x40 and 0x80, which nothing in combat reads.
