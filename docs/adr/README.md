# Architecture decision records

These are the Phase 0 decisions from the [roadmap](../roadmap.md) (task 0.5). Each record states the context, the decision, and what follows from it. When a decision changes, add a new record that supersedes the old one rather than rewriting it.

| # | Decision | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [0001](0001-importer-owns-the-rom.md) | The runtime never reads the ROM; an importer turns it into a base plugin | Accepted |
| [0002](0002-godot-and-csharp.md) | Engine: Godot 4 with C# (.NET) | Accepted, added to by [0022](0022-views-library.md) |
| [0003](0003-headless-rules-core.md) | Game rules live in a headless C# library | Accepted, partly superseded by [0015](0015-the-port-no-longer-reads-the-decomp.md) and [0018](0018-the-port-fixes-bugs-and-sets-enhancements.md) |
| [0004](0004-record-ids.md) | Record ID scheme | Accepted |
| [0005](0005-plugin-format.md) | Plugin format: JSON with comments, field-level overrides | Accepted, partly superseded by [0016](0016-sequences-keep-the-originals-events.md) |
| [0006](0006-tick-model-and-rng.md) | Tick model and RNG | Accepted, partly superseded by [0017](0017-the-core-steps-every-tick.md) |
| [0007](0007-rom-versions.md) | ROM version support | Accepted, partly superseded by [0018](0018-the-port-fixes-bugs-and-sets-enhancements.md) and [0031](0031-a-data-edit-of-1.0-imports.md) |
| [0008](0008-content-logic-layers.md) | Content logic: records, triggers, engine features, then Lua scripts | Accepted |
| [0009](0009-code-organisation.md) | Code is organised by subsystem, and the Inspector is the one tool | Accepted, partly superseded by [0010](0010-editor-reads-plugins.md), [0011](0011-one-follow-camera.md) and [0015](0015-the-port-no-longer-reads-the-decomp.md) |
| [0010](0010-editor-reads-plugins.md) | The editor reads only imported data | Accepted, partly superseded by [0012](0012-editor-holds-the-importer.md) |
| [0011](0011-one-follow-camera.md) | One follow camera, with the original's modes | Accepted |
| [0012](0012-editor-holds-the-importer.md) | The editor holds the importer and is the first run; code flows from the core to the runtime to the editor | Accepted, partly superseded by [0022](0022-views-library.md) |
| [0013](0013-settings-in-the-options-menu.md) | Graphics and fidelity settings live in the game's own options menu, kept per player rather than per save | Accepted, partly superseded by [0023](0023-the-core-is-handed-its-settings-each-tick.md) and [0024](0024-the-options-are-pages-by-kind.md) |
| [0014](0014-menus-keep-the-originals-layouts.md) | The menus keep the original's layouts at every screen size; new layouts are a modding feature after 1.0 | Accepted |
| [0015](0015-the-port-no-longer-reads-the-decomp.md) | The port no longer reads the decomp; the rig grows its own index of the code | Accepted, amended by [0030](0030-the-project-is-aidyn-renewed.md) |
| [0016](0016-sequences-keep-the-originals-events.md) | Sequences keep the original's event stream as an asset; samples are WAV | Accepted |
| [0017](0017-the-core-steps-every-tick.md) | The core steps every tick, and per-frame behaviour is matched to a frame each system names in `Cadence` | Accepted |
| [0018](0018-the-port-fixes-bugs-and-sets-enhancements.md) | The port fixes the original's bugs outright and puts enhancements behind settings; there's no fidelity toggle | Accepted, refined by [0023](0023-the-core-is-handed-its-settings-each-tick.md), added to for content by [0029](0029-content-fixes-wait-for-a-bugfix-mod.md) |
| [0019](0019-how-the-core-tells-the-views.md) | How the core tells the views what changed: host calls and cues, events for lifecycle, polling for continuous state, returned endings | Accepted |
| [0020](0020-one-effect-vocabulary.md) | One effect vocabulary for spells, potions and enchantments: records list effects of types the core implements, with Lua a reserved type | Accepted, partly superseded by [0021](0021-instant-effects-land-in-one-place.md) |
| [0021](0021-instant-effects-land-in-one-place.md) | Instant effects land in one place for any spell, potion or flask; a potion record says how it's used, and a spell record whether it's an area | Accepted |
| [0022](0022-views-library.md) | The runtime and the editor share a views library, `HBHT.Views`, in place of the editor linking the runtime's files; code flows from the core to the views to the runtime to the editor | Accepted |
| [0023](0023-the-core-is-handed-its-settings-each-tick.md) | The core is handed what it needs of the settings each tick, an immutable record made from the player's with the command line's over them; nothing in the core reads `Settings` | Accepted |
| [0024](0024-the-options-are-pages-by-kind.md) | The options are pages by kind (Audio, Video, Enhancements), in Title Case, and the sky's placement is off the menu | Accepted |
| [0025](0025-chunks-load-off-the-main-thread.md) | Chunks load off the main thread where it can't change the game: what changes it stays on the main thread, reading ahead and building nodes outside the tree go to one builder thread, and the main thread never waits on it | Accepted |
| [0026](0026-controls-are-bound-by-situation.md) | Controls are listed by what the player does in each situation, bound per device in the core, with conflicts checked within a situation and the essential controls never left unbound | Accepted |
| [0027](0027-conversations-take-the-menus-controls.md) | Cut-scenes and conversations take the menus' cursor, Accept, Back and Close Menu, and have no controls of their own | Accepted |
| [0028](0028-the-project-is-hbht.md) | The project is HBHT: the code is `HBHT.*`, the editor is `HBHT.Editor`, the tool is `hbht` and the data folder is `HBHT`; "aidyn" stays for the game's names and the imported data (record IDs, `aidyn.base`) | Superseded by [0030](0030-the-project-is-aidyn-renewed.md) |
| [0029](0029-content-fixes-wait-for-a-bugfix-mod.md) | The base import fixes only content that breaks the game; other content fixes wait for a bugfix mod | Accepted |
| [0030](0030-the-project-is-aidyn-renewed.md) | The project is Aidyn Renewed, a fork of HBHT: the code is `AidynRenewed.*`, the tool is `aidyn-renewed`, the data folder is `AidynRenewed`, the packages are the fork's own; no third-party decompilation's names are cited, and the citations 0015 kept as credit are removed | Accepted |
| [0031](0031-a-data-edit-of-1.0-imports.md) | A ROM hack of NA 1.0 that changed only bytes of the tables the layout places imports as 1.0 under its own hash; the importer's name checks against 1.0's data apply to 1.0 alone | Accepted |
| [0032](0032-rechronicled-is-read-for-its-findings.md) | Aidyn ReChronicled is cloned beside the project without its submodules and read for its findings and designs, rebuilt in the port's own code and confirmed in the machine code, with credit; its bundled decompilation stays unread, and its code, art and samples wait for its author's explicit yes | Accepted |

Statuses: **Proposed** means drafted and waiting for review. **Accepted** means agreed. **Superseded** means replaced by a later record, which it links to.
