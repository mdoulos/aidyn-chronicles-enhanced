# ROM layout and versions (roadmap 0.2, 0.3)

What the three ROMs share, where they differ, and how the Borg archive is stored. The ROMs themselves and their hashes are in the [reference rig](../reference-rig.md).

## The layout (NA 1.0)

| Region | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `0x0001000`–`0x00E7220` | Code segment. It also holds data tables, such as the per-map-set chunk lists and the dialogue SFX tables ([hardcoded content](../hardcoded-content.md)). |
| `0x00E7220`–`0x1F89C10` | **Borg archive**: about 30 MB holding every art, level, audio and dialogue asset. |
| `0x1F89C10` | The archive index. Each entry has type, compression, compressed and uncompressed sizes, and offset. |
| `0x1FC2BB0`–`0x1FEEFD0` | Fixed databases ([db](db.md)): Entity, Weapon, Armor, Spell, Item, Chest, DialogEntity, GameStateMod, GameStateFunnel, Audiokey, Journal, Theatre menu, cinematic text, controller and combat strings, CampEncounters, cheats, credits, and the item, stat and spell string tables. |

Compression comes in two schemes, LZB (most Borgs) and LZ01x (text), and strings also go through a decrypt step ([text](text.md)).

## The Borg types

| # | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Texture | N64 texel formats, with odd rows interleaved ([textures](textures.md)) |
| 2 | Geometry | Vertices plus F3DEX display lists, mostly `G_TRI1` ([geometry](geometry.md)) |
| 3 | Camera | FOV and clip planes |
| 4 | Light | |
| 5 | Scene | Transform tree, a small instruction list, and particle emitters ([scenes](scenes.md)) |
| 6 | Animation | Keyframe tracks bound to a Borg5 ([animation](animation.md)) |
| 7 | Actor | A Borg5 plus a set of Borg6 animations with branch and transition data ([actors](actors.md)) |
| 8 | UI image | |
| 9 | Map chunk | Collision triangles, ground types and map objects ([maps](maps.md)) |
| 11 | Sample | Mono PCM, signed 8-bit or 16-bit BE, with no rate of its own ([audio](audio.md)) |
| 12 | Sequence | Music and sound effects: rows of events over up to 16 tracks |
| 13 | Script | Dialogue and cut-scene bytecode with about 60 opcodes ([dialogue](dialogue.md)) |
| 0, 10, 14 | Unused | Named GEN, CollisionMaterial and GameState |

## NA 1.0 vs 1.1 and the debug ROM

1.1 is a real second revision, and 1.0 is the primary target. Compared with 1.0:

- **Borg archive and archive index:** byte-identical, moved (see the table below).
- **Code segment:** changed (about 760k bytes differ even after allowing for the move). Its data is 1.0's, moved.
- **DB block:** every record is identical. The only change is new text: five Controller Pak error messages appended to `String/Common` and four to `String/Controller`, which grew and move everything after them.

So 1.1 has code fixes and a few new messages, and all assets and records are shared.

The debug ROM's Borg archive and archive index are 1.0's too, and its DB block is 1.0's but for its credits, which are shorter (three names missing, one date different). Its code segment is a different build.

## Where each version has its tables

`RomVersions` holds one table of what the code reads: each code-segment table and each table of the DB block, with its length and NA 1.0's offset, and for a code-segment table the debug ROM's offset too. The other versions are NA 1.0 moved: a list of steps, each moving the 1.0 offsets from where it starts up to the next step by one amount, and the string tables whose length changed.

| 1.0 offsets from | NA 1.1 moves them | What's there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x008BAC4` | `-0xC4` | Code, through the spell visuals' refused and resisted actors |
| `0x008D710` | `-0xB4` | The spell visuals' functions |
| `0x008DDE4` | `-0x10` | The rest of the code, and the data up to the fonts |
| `0x00DAF08` | `+0x40` | The data from the fonts on, the Borg archive, the archive index, and the DB block to `String/Common`, which grew from `0x2830` bytes to `0x2960` |
| `0x1FEA3B0` | `+0x170` | `String/Copyright` to `String/Controller`, which grew from `0x410` bytes to `0x510` |
| `0x1FED950` | `+0x270` | `String/Combat` to the end |

Each step starts at the first 1.0 offset where 1.1's bytes match at that move. The change between them lies in the bytes before, which match neither move or are zeros (`0xD8ABC`–`0xDAF08` for `+0x40`). 1.1's code before `0x8BAC4` moves by other amounts, mostly `-0xD0`, which no table needs yet.

The debug ROM moves 1.0's Borg archive and DB block by `+0xEB80`, and `String/PotionNames` by `+0xEB50`, after its credits, which are `0x6F0` bytes, not `0x720`. Its code segment's data is in nearly the same order as 1.0's but moves by a different amount almost table by table (`+0xB058` to `+0xEB80`), so its code-segment tables, and the map sets' chunk lists at `0xEA850`, are their own column.

The tables' bytes are 1.0's in every version except where the build put addresses in them: the spell visuals' code and jump tables, and the pointer tables (`Cinematics`, `CinematicFades`, `MinimapSections`). `RomLayoutTests.EveryTableIsWhereTheRomHasIt` checks every table in every version against 1.0's: the same bytes, the same strings (but for the three that changed), the same instructions without their immediates, jump table entries landing at the same place in the same function, and pointers to the same bytes.

A new table is one row: its length, 1.0's offset and the debug ROM's. 1.1 needs nothing more unless the table is before `0x8BAC4`.

## Data edits of 1.0

A ROM hack that changed only bytes inside the tables 1.0's layout places, the DB block's databases and string tables and the code segment's tables, imports as NA 1.0 under its own hash ([ADR 0031](../adr/0031-a-data-edit-of-1.0-imports.md)). `RomVersions.FindDataEdit` tells one by its **frame**: the SHA-1 of the image with the header's two checksums (`0x10`–`0x17`) and every placed table zeroed. 1.0's frame is `bfffd55d661378dc94133f1e263e04be0fc05d69` (`RomVersions.Na10Frame`), and a data edit's is the same.

The 26 hacks of 1.0 the project's owner made, the Action Edition and the Doulos Edit, are all data edits. The Action Edition of Feb 7, 2026 (SHA-1 `4bbb9fcd…262e`) differs from 1.0 in these tables and nowhere else but the checksums:

| Table | Bytes that differ |
| --- | --- |
| Entities | 2110 |
| Shops | 1887 |
| Items | 908 |
| Weapons | 760 |
| Armor | 487 |
| Chests | 281 |
| Potion prices (code) | 25 |
| Skill training costs (code) | 20 |
| Potion recipes (code) | 13 |
| Weapon training costs (code) | 6 |
| Stat training costs (code) | 5 |

It moves weapons between positions as well as changing their numbers: position 53, the Bow of Accuracy in 1.0, is the Poisoned Bow. The original's code keys a flying weapon's speed by its position, so the importer's checks of a fact's name against 1.0's data apply to 1.0 alone.

## The Borg archive

- **All three ROMs share one Borg archive**, byte for byte, at their own offsets.
- **The archive index's header** is the entry count followed by the archive's size in bytes, which equals the index's offset less the archive's start in every version.
- **Stored sizes are padded to 8 bytes** with zeros, and entries start on 16-byte boundaries. An LZB stream therefore ends 0–7 bytes before its stored size.
- **Compression:** a Borg is LZB or stored raw; none uses LZ01x, which only text does. LZB is UCL's NRV2B with an 8-bit bit buffer. LZ01x is LZO1X from LZO 1.06.
