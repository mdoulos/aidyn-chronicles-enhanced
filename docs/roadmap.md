# Aidyn Chronicles Reimplementation: Roadmap

Sep 26, 2026 · Updated Oct 24, 2026

## Summary

A PC reimplementation of Aidyn Chronicles: The First Mage that runs on content imported from a user-supplied ROM, with a plugin-based mod system on top. Phase 0 laid the foundations, Phase 1 decoded the formats in parallel tracks, and everything since lands as playable vertical slices on a headless rules core.

**Quest logic is almost entirely data, not code.** The game runs on three data systems: an event-flag logic network (`GameStateFunnel`, [flags](systems/flags.md)), a dialogue and cut-scene bytecode (Borg13, [scripts](systems/scripts.md)), and map objects gated by flags (Borg9, [map-objects](systems/map-objects.md)). So extracting quests is a file-format problem. The code-lifting work is in **combat formulas, AI, and the places where engine code hardcodes content** ([hardcoded-content](hardcoded-content.md)). The game's content is already keyed records in tables and one big asset archive ([rom](formats/rom.md)), which makes a Bethesda-style mod system a natural fit.

These systems are ported from the machine code rather than parsed from data: combat (the debug build's `combatengine/combat.cpp`, `combatEntity.cpp`, `turn.cpp` and `src/gamecombat.cpp`), its AI (`combatengine/aiInfo.cpp` and `aiscores.cpp`), character and party logic (2.2, 2.3), movement and physics (M1), wanderers (M2), and the hardcoded content (1H). The debug build "02.01d-PRERELEASE" names the original's source files and some functions, which the port uses (0.9).

## Where things stand

This is the one list of what's open. A task's status is in its phase's table below, and what was found and built is in the docs. When something finishes, take it off here, mark its task and suggest what's next. When a playtest or a finished task leaves work behind, add it here. What only the user can check is in [user-checks](user-checks.md).

### Next

**M4: the prologue** is done: the user played it side by side with the emulator, and what differed is fixed ([playtests](playtests.md)). Next, by the phases' order, is **Phase 4: content parity**, once the user has played the fixes and settled what they left:

1. **The fixes in play,** and their [user checks](user-checks.md): the cut-outs' fuller foliage, the post-battle level-up, a defeat's fade and the load menu's new game; and the title screen, its intro cards, fly-throughs and menu, with the game over and the ending's credits going back to it ([ui](systems/ui.md#the-title-screen)).
2. **The user's choices** from them: whether a new game's save edited in the editor still plays the opening; the rain loop under the post-battle windows hushed or stopped; the console's cracks between meshes reproduced, welded or left; and mipmaps for the textures the ROM gives none.
3. **What they left:** which cut-scene the user saw end without the minimap growing, as the core grows it after every one ([ui](systems/ui.md)); the remembered member and tab carried across a load, as the original keeps the member; translucent scenery drawn after bodies, which tints the dress's hem in the misty sea's cut-scene ([rendering](systems/rendering.md#whats-left)); and a cut-scene's view 10–13% wider than the original's, the emulator's crop or the camera's field of view.

### Left over from finished work

- **M2:** the editor showing cut-scenes on its map, and the HUD in the editor; Alaron's requests as he opens a container (11) or a door (19), an explosion's particles and the trek popups' fades ([map-objects](systems/map-objects.md#whats-left)); and the quest atlas reading the combat record's boss flags.
- **1H:** the content literals [still in code](hardcoded-content.md#still-in-code) rather than records (the protagonist's entity, the backdrops' styles, the skill checks' numbers and the like).
- **Weather:** a Day or Night spell's hold on the part of day doesn't stop the weather's roll under it in a battle ([magic](systems/magic.md#where-the-port-differs)).
- **2.10:** what else could move onto triggers, each with its event ([events](systems/events.md#what-else-could-move-onto-triggers)): the first spell and potion's help (`spell.learned`, `item.bought`), the new journal entry's notice (`journal.added`), the camp scenes (`camp.started`), the cheat codes (`cheat.entered`), the Shadow's cinematic and the Goblin Ambush's end (`battle.ended` with its outcome), and a conversation's end as `script.ended`. The editor has no view of the triggers of its own, and the quest atlas doesn't show what they read and set.
- **The lit lighthouse:** Overworld A15 and Lighthouse A05 swap to their lit scenes while 5017 holds (`CheckToggleZoneScene`, `0x8000aa14`; [hardcoded content](hardcoded-content.md)), which the port doesn't do yet. Its read of 5017 as those chunks load also brings the flags up to date ([flags](systems/flags.md#when-the-network-comes-up-to-date)).
- **Rendering:** the items in [rendering](systems/rendering.md#whats-left): the lens flare's test, the sky overhead, texture filtering, environment maps in trek, which scenes are drawn, and the editor's billboards and containers. Translucent scenery over bodies is in [Next](#next).
- **Rig:** measure the frame `delta` in combat, which can help choose its frame for per-frame behaviour ([ADR 0017](adr/0017-the-core-steps-every-tick.md)); it also sets how long a one-shot request is held and rounds an attack's strike to a frame ([combat](systems/combat.md#an-attack)). Checkpoint 10 suggests 3.
- **M3:** `Talk`'s collision byte, which turns a used monster party's enemies to face the party when it's used from behind ([combat](systems/combat.md#the-port)). From the special battles: the merge's shield test turned round, which the data never reaches; idle bodies far from the camera that combat doesn't animate (`Body.AlwaysAnimated`); a falling body's root motion, which the original skips; the half-alpha shadows of a few entities; combat's frame-counter limit on pausing; and the glide's aim by the original's eye height ([combat](systems/combat.md#where-the-port-differs)). The rest of what M3 left is in [combat](systems/combat.md#not-settled)'s Not settled and the [user checks](user-checks.md#combat): no checkpoint holds the special battles, and none a caster's turn.
- **What the bodies hold** ([combat](systems/combat.md#what-the-bodies-hold)): an arrow, flask or thrown weapon flying not at all from an actor without the hand's locator, as `Combat.StartCastCamera` does; what's held lit at its locator rather than the body's centre; and the user's look at how the hands hold them ([user-checks](user-checks.md#combat)).

### Maybe

- The editor showing wanderers on its map view.
- **Closing the meshes' seams,** an option on import: the original's models have cracks where vertices don't quite meet (down Abrecan's face, the tree walls short of the ground), which the console shows too. Welding them, then a visual review of everything.
- **Faster battles,** a setting, after combat's parity fixes: the next combatant starts moving while the last action plays, once nothing it touches is still in that action, as Ogre Battle 64 does. The rules and their random numbers stay as they are, since an attack's outcome is rolled when it's chosen; only what's drawn overlaps. The camera can pick shots that hold both, scoring angles by raycast.

## Phases

Sizes are relative: S, M, L, XL. **Bold** tasks block other work. Phase 0 settled how the reimplementation is built, in the binding [ADRs](adr/README.md).

### Phase 0: Foundations

| Task | Size | Output | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0.1 Reference rig.** An emulator with a debugger, the NA 1.0 and debug ROMs, and save states at story checkpoints. | S | [reference-rig](reference-rig.md) | Done |
| **0.2 ROM identification.** Hashing, byte-order normalisation, header parsing, and a per-version offset table. | S | `RomImage` | Done |
| **0.3 Borg archive reader.** The archive index and the LZB and LZ01x decompressors. | M | Unblocked Phase 1 | Done |
| **0.4 DB table readers,** cross-checked against AidynEditor. | M | Typed records | Done |
| **0.5 Architecture decisions** as ADRs. | S | `docs/adr/` | Done |
| **0.6 Asset inspector,** which becomes the editor over imported data ([ADR 0010](adr/0010-editor-reads-plugins.md)). | M, ongoing | [editor](systems/editor.md) | Done Sep 30, 2026; grows into the mod editor (Phase 5) |

#### Reading the code with our own rig

Since [ADR 0015](adr/0015-the-port-no-longer-reads-the-decomp.md) the project reads only the ROM, the emulator and its own rig. These tasks give the rig a way to find a system's code, names for it, and the layout of what it touches. The [reference rig](reference-rig.md) says how to use each. Anything derived from the ROMs goes to the gitignored `out/`, except the symbol map, which holds only addresses and our names.

| Task | Size | Output | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0.7 Code index.** Every function, its callers and callees, the data and strings it references, and the jump tables. | M | Finding code by what it touches | Done Oct 4, 2026, as an export from Ghidra (0.14) |
| **0.8 Symbol map.** `tools/symbols/`, our names for addresses, which every research run adds to. | S, then ongoing | Calls named in every disassembly | Seeded Oct 4, 2026; ongoing |
| **0.9 Source files and the two builds.** Tie the debug build's functions to its source files, and match 1.0's functions to the debug build's so names carry across. | M | `tools/builds.py` | Done Oct 4, 2026 |
| **0.10 RAM maps.** `bst.py --diff` between two checkpoints. Structures' fields go in their system's doc. | S | Where a value lives | Done Oct 4, 2026 |
| **0.11 gdb on a checkpoint.** | S–M | Watchpoints from a checkpoint | Done Oct 4, 2026: `tools/gdb.ps1`, 1.0's checkpoints only ([rig](reference-rig.md#gdb-on-a-checkpoint-toolsgdbps1-roadmap-011)) |
| **0.12 Traces.** Which functions run during an action, against standing still. | M | The code an action runs | Done Oct 4, 2026: `tools/trace.ps1` |
| **0.13 Combat captures** (the user). Checkpoints in and around battles, from an unmodified 1.0 game: on the field just before one, its first turn, before and after a melee attack, before and after a spell, an enemy's turn, fleeing, and victory with its loot and experience screens. | S | Combat's RAM, before and after each thing it does | Done Oct 18, 2026: 14 checkpoints of one battle, from the field before it to the loot |
| **0.14 A decompiler of our own.** Ghidra headless over 1.0, with the symbol map applied. | S | Readable pseudocode | Done Oct 4, 2026 |

### Phase 1: Format decoding

Each track ends with an exporter to an open format and a viewer in the editor: if it round-trips visually, it's understood.

| Track | Tasks | Size | Validation | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1A Static graphics** | Borg1 textures, Borg8 UI images, Borg2 via a minimal F3DEX interpreter, Borg3 cameras, Borg4 lights, Borg5 scenes | L | glTF export of a building and a character matches the emulator | Done |
| **1B Animation** | Borg6 tracks, Borg7 actors, Borg5 particles | L | The opening cinematic plays in the editor | Done Sep 27, 2026 |
| **1C Maps** | Chunk tables per map set, Borg9 collision and map objects, Expansion Pak variants | L | A map viewer shows a whole map set with its objects | Done Sep 27, 2026 |
| **1D Audio** | Borg11 PCM, Borg12 sequences and their playback, the audiokey table | M | BGM plays correctly | Done Oct 10, 2026; what isn't played yet is in [audio](systems/audio.md) |
| **1E Quest atlas** | Borg13 decoding with its branching, the flag network, flag cross-references, journal linkage | L | What sets and reads every flag, and which journal entry it maps to (`aidyn-renewed flag <n>`, and the editor's Atlas tab) | Done |
| **1F Text & UI assets** | String tables, the fonts, portraits, menu images | S | The dialogue box renders in the right font | Done |
| **1G Saves** (optional) | Importing the original's Controller Pak saves | M | An original save imports | Open. The checkpoints already convert into saves (2.8). |
| **1H Hardcoded content** | Every piece of content in code rather than data, each assigned an [ADR 0008](adr/0008-content-logic-layers.md) layer | M | [hardcoded-content](hardcoded-content.md) | Done Oct 19, 2026: every content table is read or carried |

### Phase 2: Rules core (headless, test-driven)

Where a task names the original's code, the file names are the debug build's.

| Task | Size | Source | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **2.1 Flag engine.** `ProcessGameStates`, plus the time, calendar, weather, terrain and stat flag setters. | M | `gamestatefunnel.cpp` | Done |
| **2.2 Characters.** Attributes, skills, levels, hit points, experience, training costs, modifiers, resistances. | M | `gameclasses/` | Done Sep 30, 2026 |
| **2.3 Items & inventory.** Equip rules, shops, chests, crafting. | M | `data/itemdb.cpp`, `chestdb.cpp`, `shopdb.cpp` | Done Oct 1, 2026 |
| **2.4 Borg13 VM.** Camera and actor cues go out through a host interface, so the core stays headless. | M | `dialogue.cpp` | Done |
| **2.5 Combat rules.** Turn order, field-of-influence radius, hit, damage and crit, spells (targeting, radius, reagents, battery), status effects, reserve spawns, leader and flee logic, rewards. | **XL** | `combatengine/combat.cpp`, `combatEntity.cpp`, `turn.cpp`, `src/gamecombat.cpp` | Done Oct 19, 2026, with M3 ([combat](systems/combat.md)) |
| **2.6 Enemy AI.** | L | `combatengine/aiInfo.cpp`, `aiscores.cpp` | Done Oct 19, 2026, with M3 ([combat](systems/combat.md#the-ai)) |
| **2.7 Time & camping.** See [camping](systems/camping.md). | S | `sundial.cpp`, `menus/campmenucontroller.cpp` | Done Oct 18, 2026 |
| **2.8 Save/load** in the engine's own format. See [saves](systems/saves.md). | S | `questdata.cpp`, `saveParty.cpp` | Done Oct 1, 2026 |
| **2.9 Differential tests.** Capture the random values the emulator consumed (ADR 0006), replay them into the core, and compare damage and turn logs. | L, ongoing | | Started: the checkpoints of one battle replay its setup, turns, a cast and attacks ([combat](systems/combat.md#the-port)) |
| **2.10 Events and triggers.** The core's named event list, and trigger records (*on event, if condition, do effects*) in Borg13's condition and effect vocabulary. Engine features that replace bespoke code (ADR 0008 layer 3) land with their system. | M | The 1H audit | Done Oct 19, 2026, with the cinematics' ([events](systems/events.md)); what else could move onto them is [above](#left-over-from-finished-work) |

### Phase 3: Godot runtime

A series of vertical slices, each one playable ([runtime](systems/runtime.md)).

| Slice | Contents | Needs | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **M1: Walk Gwernia** | The chunk streamer, terrain, the N64 material, collision, the player, the follow camera, the sky, draw distance | 1A, 1C | Done Sep 29, 2026 |
| **M2: Talk and trade** | Map objects, wanderers, conversations, shops, the pause menu, the journal, cut-scenes, training, camping, the HUD | 1E, 1F, 2.1–2.4 | Done Oct 4, 2026; leftovers [above](#left-over-from-finished-work) |
| **M3: Fight** | Arena loading, spawns, the turn UI, radius targeting, spell visuals and particles, the combat log, status icons, post-battle XP and loot screens | 1B, 2.5, 2.6 | Done Oct 19, 2026 ([combat](systems/combat.md#the-port)); leftovers [above](#left-over-from-finished-work) |
| **M4: The prologue** | From the opening through leaving Gwernia, end to end | Everything above | Done Oct 22, 2026, after the user's side-by-side playthrough ([playtests](playtests.md)); what it left is [above](#next) |
| **M5: Full playthrough parity** | Every region, every quest and the ending, checked against the quest atlas | Phase 4 | |

### Phase 4: Content parity

Mostly testing rather than engineering (XL).

- Walk every region against the emulator and log differences.
- Use the quest atlas as a checklist: every flag reachable, every journal entry obtainable.
- Rules parity: shops, trainers, loot tables and camp encounters for each area.
- Decide which of the original's bugs to keep or fix, one at a time and with no toggle ([ADR 0018](adr/0018-the-port-fixes-bugs-and-sets-enhancements.md)), such as the `CheckPartyGoldU16` truncation and the crash when `TakeItem` runs on an item the party doesn't have. (The spell auras' turn cycle is settled: the original's by default, each character's as the `SpellAuras` setting.)

### Phase 5: Mod system and tools

The base game is a plugin, so the mod format is exercised all the time; Phase 5 exposes it and builds tooling on top.

| Task | Size | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plugin loader: load order, dependencies, field-level merge, conflict report | M | Done: `PluginSet`, `aidyn-renewed conflicts`, `aidyn-renewed schema` |
| Flag and ID allocation for mod namespaces | S | |
| Asset overrides (glTF, PNG, OGG) and new assets | M | |
| Scripting: a Borg13 superset for dialogue and cut-scenes, plus sandboxed Lua event handlers on the 2.10 events (ADR 0008). Mods can't load .NET assemblies. | L | |
| **Editor.** Grow the editor into a Construction Set: record editing, dialogue graph editing, map object placement, and a quest atlas that includes mod content | XL | |
| Documentation and a sample mod (a new trainer, a new quest and a rebalanced spell) | M | |
| A bugfix mod: the content fixes the user chooses, as patches to the base plugin ([ADR 0029](adr/0029-content-fixes-wait-for-a-bugfix-mod.md)). So far: script 1040's node 24, Dougal's, linked to node 25, so the harbour reunion plays with him in the party ([scripts](systems/scripts.md#faults)) | S | |

### Phase 6: Enhancements (optional, post-parity)

Widescreen, higher resolution, higher frame rate, longer draw distance, rebindable controls, and quality-of-life options such as visible stealth feedback, each a setting on the options menu ([ADR 0018](adr/0018-the-port-fixes-bugs-and-sets-enhancements.md)). Some came early and are the default: the floating conversation box and a UI screen of any shape. Rebindable controls came early too, with mouse look ([ui](systems/ui.md#controls)). Their faithful mode, with its overscan bars, is left for here ([ui](systems/ui.md#a-faithful-mode-later)).

## Risk register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Combat and AI formulas are hard to verify by eye | Balance feels "off" | Exact RNG port plus differential tests (2.9). Read constants from the machine code rather than inferring them from play. |
| Finding code with only the ROM, the emulator and our own rig ([ADR 0015](adr/0015-the-port-no-longer-reads-the-decomp.md)) | Research runs cost more, and a system's code can be missed | The code index and the symbol map replace any third-party map, with the debug build's source files (0.7–0.9) and watchpoints and traces on checkpoints (0.11, 0.12). |
| Content hardcoded in code that the audit misses | Mods can't reach it, or content is missing | The 1H audit and the quest atlas's reachability check in Phase 4 |
| Scope fatigue over several years | Project dies | Vertical slices so something is always playable. The editor is useful to the community on its own. |
| Legal | Takedown | Never distribute ROM-derived assets or data; plugins ship only as deltas and original assets. The project reads only the ROM, the emulator and its own rig ([ADR 0015](adr/0015-the-port-no-longer-reads-the-decomp.md)). |
